                            Because of the speed in which they're delivered to your screen, your conscious mind will merely see a "flicker" — it won't have the pace to capture the message.

                            Your brain is a fascinating machine that has the capability to absorb thousands of pieces of information daily. Every day, you're exposed to more than 100,000 thoughts that influence your decision making abilities, your beliefs, your ideas, your patterns - even your core values.

                            Your subconscious mind is built as a tool for betterment. It's there to respond to your environment. It "sees" things you don't even realize. Every sound. Every picture. Every phonetic nuance. Everything.

                        You know, I have more than <strong>150 self-help books</strong> in my personal library. Over the past decade, I've read more books on <strong>psychology and human performance</strong> than most people would read in ten different lifetimes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="rst-text">
                        <strong>I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on books, courses, seminars.</strong> I've subscribed to the most cutting-edge educational publications that money can buy, and spent thousands of hours of my time digesting it.
