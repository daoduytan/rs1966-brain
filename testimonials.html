                                <p>You've done it again! you've pulled another master piece of self-improvement out of the bag!</p>

                                <p>Brain Bullet is simply awesome!</p>

                                <p>By taking the most powerful, highly effective and scientifically proven concept of subliminal messaging you've given me a way to gain immediate access to my sub-conscious mind.</p>

                                <p>As you know your subconscious mind is infinitely powerful and makes your life exactly what your conscious mind tells it to be. The problem I had was my conscious mind had it's own agenda, so not all the right messages were getting through.</p>

                                <p>Thanks to Brain Bullet this has all changed, I can now turn on my PC and go about a normal day. Only this time a direct link is open and my sub conscious mind is being systematically re-programmed for success!</p>

                                <p>I give Brain Bullet my highest possible recommendation, ...thanks a million Lee!</p>

                                <p> Hi Justin, (one of our affiliates)</p>

                                <p>I'm writing to thank you for sending {Brain Bullet} to me. Normally I delete most messages that tell me something is "urgent" because it's usually a lie.</p>

                                <p>But when I read about this software, I realized that it was an improvement of some shareware that used to be available for a free trial back in 1998, and it works. It's really that simple, it really does work.</p>

                                <p>I've always been into affirmations and goal setting, that's how I got where I am, and how, I believe, I'll get where I'm going. I used a mixture of Napoleon Hill's goal setting plan and one developed by Tony Robbins to create three pages of goals and aspirations for myself, along with some affirmations I adjusted from a book called Pyramids of Power.</p>

                                <p>But what always happens with affirmations and written goals is that life takes you to a place where you forget, or neglect, to read them daily, which is what makes them work so powerfully.</p>

                                <p>And yet even with neglect, those ideas went undercover in my psyche, and the ones I would work towards daily would still manifest, just more slowly, and with a lot more effort on my part.</p>

                                <p>Thanks to you and the author of this program for placing it back on the market. Please forward my testimonial to the product creator, or let me know where I can contact him (or her?)</p>

                                <p>Thanks again,</p>

                                <p>Ever since, I've been receiving tons of positive feedback back at our office... they love Brain Bullet! Everyone who wants to achieve more from their businesses and their lives should get a copy -- period.</p>

                                <p>I worked in the field of Psychological Operations for the US Military in the 70's and 80's.</p>

                                <p>I learned about subliminal programming and learned how to do this in written materials that were to be used during military operations (war). So when I met the Brain Bullet I got excited because it was a familiar concept.</p>

                                <p>My very first thought was: Oh wow! How many online and Network marketers do I know who have a fear of calling their leads? Boy this could make such a difference!</p>

                                <p>This could rebuild self esteem after having been a battered woman. Give someone the courage to try another business opportunity after not doing so well before.</p>

                                <p>Well all those things were handled by being fed positive affirmations on a regular basis. I edited some to handle my specific issues, and I can now call my leads without having to talk myself into it. I am doing wonderful in my new business, I even learned how to build a website and my self esteem in way up there... I give the BB the credit.</p>

                                <p>It painlessly changed my mind.</p>
